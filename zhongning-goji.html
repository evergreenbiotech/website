													<h3>Zhongning Goji Berry</h3>
												</header>
												<p>The Chinese people's obsession with ‘health preservation’ is probably unmatched by any other nation in the world.</p>
												<p>After all, the saying ‘soaking goji berries in a thermos’ has long been a common sight in the daily lives of many Chinese people.</p>
												<p>Those who are more particular about their health even add a few goji berries to their water cups year-round.</p>
												<p>For the Chinese, the enthusiasm for soaking goji berries in water also stems from their value as both food and medicine.  
												<br>In Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" (本草纲目), there is this description: ‘Goji berries nourish the kidneys and generate essence, nourish the liver and improve vision, strengthen bones, alleviate fatigue, enhance complexion, whiten the skin, clarify the eyes and calm the mind, and promote longevity.’</p>
												<p>Additionally, the description, ‘In spring, the leaves are harvested and called Tianjingcao (天精草); in summer, the flowers are harvested and called Changshengcao (夏采花); in autumn, the berries are harvested and called Goji berries (枸杞子); in winter, the roots are harvested and called Diguipi (地骨皮)’, further highlights the ‘tenfold wonders’ of Goji berries, where every part of the plant is valuable.</p>
												<p>Globally, Goji berries are not a rare plant and are cultivated in some Asian countries.</p>
												<p>In China, there are even more regions where goji berries are cultivated, including Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Xinjiang, and Heilongjiang.</p>
												<p>However, among these goji berry-producing regions, only ‘Zhongning Goji Berries’ have gained worldwide fame, and they are the only goji berry variety officially approved by the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China for geographical indication registration protection.</p>
												<p>‘All goji berries come from Ningxia, and Zhongning goji berries are the best in the world.’</p>
												<p>Among all goji berry production areas, those from Zhongning, Ningxia, are often praised for their exceptional quality.</p>
												<p>The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (shortened to Ningxia) is one of China's five major minority autonomous regions.</p>
												<p>Its overall terrain is located on the Loess Plateau, with the Yellow River flowing through it. The surrounding areas are either deserts or hills, so many people who have visited Ningxia for tourism have their first impression of the colour yellow. </p>
												<p>Zhongning County is located in the northeast of Ningxia, at the transition zone between the Inner Mongolia Plateau and the Loess Plateau.</p>
												<p>The Helan Mountains to the north of Zhongning block the cold winds and sandstorms from the northwest, while the Qing Shui River to the south is rich in minerals and trace elements. When it meets the Yellow River, which carries silt and sand, it creates the ideal soil for growing goji berries.</p>
												<p>Additionally, the region enjoys abundant sunlight, arid conditions with little rainfall, strong evaporation, and significant day-night temperature differences, all of which are highly conducive to the accumulation of sugars in goji berries.</p>
												<p>Under these favourable geographical and climatic conditions, Zhongning County has produced the highest-quality goji berries in China and even the world.</p>
												<p>Zhongning Goji Berries feature large fresh berries with few seeds, thick flesh, and a vibrant red colour; dried berries have thin skins, a pure and sweet taste, and unique medicinal and culinary value, making them unparalleled in quality. They are the only goji berry variety listed in the "New China Pharmacopoeia" (新中国药典) and the first to receive ‘authentic medicinal herb’ certification.</p>

													<h3>Chenpi</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Chenpi, also known as dried citrus peel, is the dried mature peel of the tangerine plant and its cultivated varieties. It has a long history of medicinal use, first recorded in the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing. Traditional medical practitioners have long held that if Chenpi is stored for too short a period, its harsh and drying properties remain, leading to significant adverse effects. However, after being stored for several years, its harsh and drying properties gradually diminish, becoming neither harsh nor drying, with a pure and rich aroma, making it more suitable for clinical treatment. The herb is classified into "Chenpi" and "Guang Chenpi". </p>

													<h3>Dendrobium Officinale</h3>
												</header>
												<p>Dendrobium is also known as Linlan (林兰), Jinsheng (禁生), Dulan (杜兰), Xuanzhu (悬竹), and Qiannianzhu (千年竹). According to the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (中国药典), Dendrobium refers to the cultivated varieties of the orchid family plants Dendrobium chrysanthum, Dendrobium nobile, and Dendrobium moniliforme, as well as the fresh or dried stems of similar species within the same genus. There are approximately 1,000 species of Dendrobium plants, with over 70 species found in China. They are primarily distributed in the southwestern, central southern, and eastern regions of China. Although the number of species is significant, only a limited number are suitable for medicinal use.</p>
